📌 Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically label support tickets, helping companies organize and respond to queries efficiently.

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TfidfVectorizer

Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes

🚀 Key Steps
Load and clean the dataset

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, etc.)

Convert text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF

Train a classification model

Evaluate performance with accuracy and confusion matrix

📁 How to Use
Open the notebook Automatic Ticket Classification.ipynb

Run all cells step-by-step

Update with your own ticket data if needed
